Parsing such addresses is challenging because of a lack of inherent structure or hierarchy. It is imperative to understand the language of addresses, so that shipments can be routed without delays. In this paper, we propose a novel approach towards understanding customer addresses by deriving motivation from recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP). We also formulate different pre-processing steps for addresses using a combination of edit distance and phonetic algorithms. Then we approach the task of creating vector representations for addresses using Word2Vec with TF-IDF, Bi-LSTM and BERT based approaches. We compare these approaches with respect to sub-region classification task for North and South Indian cities. Through experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of generalized RoBERTa model, pre-trained over a large address corpus for language modelling task. Our proposed RoBERTa model achieves a classification accuracy of around 90% with minimal text preprocessing for sub-region classification task outperforming all other approaches. Once pre-trained, the RoBERTa model can be fine-tuned for various downstream tasks in supply chain like pincode suggestion and geo-coding. The model generalizes well for such tasks even with limited labelled data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first of its kind research proposing a novel approach of understanding customer addresses in e-commerce domain by pre-training language models and fine-tuning them for different purposes.","tags":[],"title":"Deep Contextual Embeddings for Address Classification in E-commerce","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Joy Mustafi","Lakshya Kumar","Rajdeep Dua"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

We analyze the challenges of the problem, and present Rule-based, Machine Learning and Deep Learning approaches to detect sarcasm in numerical portions of text. Our Deep Learning approach outperforms four past works for sarcasm detection and Rule-based and Machine learning approaches on a dataset of tweets, obtaining an F1-score of 0.93. This shows that special attention to text containing numbers may be useful to improve state-of-the-art in sarcasm detection.","tags":[],"title":"“Having 2 hours to write a paper is fun!”: Detecting Sarcasm in NumericalPortions of Text","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Raksha Sharma","Arpan Somani","Lakshya Kumar","Pushpak Bhattacharyya"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.
